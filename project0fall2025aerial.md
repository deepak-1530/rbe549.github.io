## 1. Deadline 
**11:59:59 PM, August 26, 2025.**

## 2. Phase 1: IMU Attitude Estimation

<a name='prob1'></a>
### 2.1. Problem Statement 
In this phase, you will implement three methods to estimate the three dimensional orientation/attitude. You are given data from an [ArduIMU+ V2](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/9956), a six degree of freedom Inertial Measurement Unit (6-DoF IMU) sensor i.e., readings from a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer. You will estimate the underlying 3D orientation and compare it with the ground truth data given by a [Vicon motion capture system](https://www.vicon.com/).

<a name='data1'></a>
### 2.2. Reading the Data
The `Phase1\Data` folder has two subfolders, one which has the raw IMU data `Phase1\Data\Train\IMU` and another one which has the Vicon data `Phase1\Data\Train\Vicon`. The data in each folder is numbered for correspondence, i.e., `Phase1\Data\Train\IMU\imuRaw1.mat` corresponds to `Phase1\Data\Train\Vicon\viconRot1.mat`. Download the project 0 package from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EhSywBhsXSyUUijVkeRaEO-5auc8paVO/view?usp=sharing) which includes the data in `Phase1` folder. These data files are given in a `.mat` format. In order to read these files in Python, use the snippet provided below:

```
>>> from scipy import io
>>> x = io.loadmat("filename.mat")
```

This will return data in a dictionary format. Please disregard the following keys and corresponding values: `__version__`, `__header__`, `__global__`. The keys: `vals` and `ts` are the main data you need to use. `ts` are the timestamps and `vals` are values from the IMU. Each column of `vals` denotes data in the following order: $$ \begin{bmatrix} a_x & a_y & a_z & \omega_z & \omega_x & \omega_y\end{bmatrix}^T$$. Note that these values are not in physical units and need to undergo a conversion. 

To convert the acceleration values to $$ms^{-2}$$, follow these steps. 

$$  
\tilde{a_x} = \frac{a_x + b_{a,x}}{s_x} \\
$$

Follow the same steps for $$a_y$$ and $$a_z$$. Here $$\tilde{a_x}$$ represents the value of $$a_x$$ in physical units, $$b_{a,x}$$ is the bias and $$s_x$$ is the scale factor of the accelerometer. 

To read accelerometer bias and scale parameters, load the `Data\IMUParams.mat` file. `IMUParams` is a $$2 \times 3$$ vector where the first row denotes the scale values $$\begin{bmatrix} s_x & s_y & s_z \end{bmatrix}$$. The second row denotes the biases (computed as the average biases of all sequences using vicon) $$\begin{bmatrix} b_{a, x} & b_{a, y} & b_{a, z} \end{bmatrix}$$. 

To convert $$\omega$$ to $$rads^{-1}$$, 

$$
\tilde{\omega} = \frac{3300}{1023} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \times 0.3 \times \left(\omega - b_{g}\right)
$$

Here, $$\tilde{\omega}$$ represents the value of $$\omega$$ in physical units and $$b_g$$ is the bias. $$b_g$$ is calculated as the average of first few hundred samples (assuming that the IMU is at rest in the beginning). 

From the Vicon data, you will need the following 2 keys: `ts` and `rots`. `ts` is the timestamps of size $$1 \times N$$ as before and `rots` is a $$3\times 3\times  N$$ matrix denoting the `Z-Y-X` Euler Angles rotation matrix estimated by Vicon. 

An image of the rig used for data collection is shown below:

### 2.3. Sensor Calibration
Note that the registration between the IMU coordinate system and the Vicon global coordinate system might not be aligned at start. You might have to align them. 

The Vicon and IMU data are NOT hardware synchronized, although the timestamps `ts` of the respective data are correct. Use `ts` as the reference while plotting the orientation from Vicon and IMU. You can also do a software synchronization using the time stamps. You can align the data from the two closest timestamps from IMU and Vicon data respectively or interpolate using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp">Slerp</a>. **You can use any third party code for alignment of timestamps.**


<a name='implementation1'></a>
### 2.4. Implementation

1. You will write a function that computes orientation only based on gyro data (using integration, assume that you know the initial orientation from Vicon). Check if that works well. Plot the results and verify. Add the plot to your report file. For references, watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hRoASoBEwY&list=PLZgpos4wVnCYhf5jsl2HcsCl_Pql6Kigk&index=3">here</a> and read the tutorial <a href="https://nitinjsanket.github.io/tutorials/attitudeest/imu.html">here</a>. Feel free to explore other resources to learn these concepts. Usage of ChatGPT is also encouraged as long as you do not blatantly plagiarize. 
2. You will write another function that computes orientation only based on accelerometer data (assume that the IMU is only rotating). Verify if that function works well before you try to integrate them into a single filter. Add the plot to your report file.For references, watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hRoASoBEwY&list=PLZgpos4wVnCYhf5jsl2HcsCl_Pql6Kigk&index=3">here</a> and read the tutorial here <a href="https://nitinjsanket.github.io/tutorials/attitudeest/imu.html"></a>. Feel free to explore other resources to learn these concepts. Usage of ChatGPT is also encouraged as long as you do not blatantly plagiarize.
3. You will write a third function that uses simple complementary filter to fuse estimates from both the gyroscope and accelerometer. Make sure this works well before you implement the next step. You should observe the estimates to be almost an average of the previous two estimates. Report the value of fusion factor $$\alpha$$ in your report. Also, add the plot to your report file.For references, watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hRoASoBEwY&list=PLZgpos4wVnCYhf5jsl2HcsCl_Pql6Kigk&index=3">here</a> and read the tutorial here <a href="https://nitinjsanket.github.io/tutorials/attitudeest/imu.html"></a>. Feel free to explore other resources to learn these concepts. Usage of ChatGPT is also encouraged as long as you do not blatantly plagiarize.


In the starter code, a function called `rotplot.py` is also included. Use this function to visualize the orientation of your output. To plot the orientation, you need to give a $$3 \times 3$$ rotation matrix as an input.

## 3. Phase 2: Waypoint Navigation and AprilTag Landing

<a name='prob2'></a>
### 3.1. Problem Statement 
In this phase, you will design and implement a navigation and landing system for a simulated quadrotor in an environment. The quadrotor is equipped with the ability to navigate to the provided 3D position waypoint. You are required to autonomously navigate through a sequence of predefined waypoints given as a `.csv` file. Read the waypoints and navigate through them. You are required to render RGB-D frames at every iteration and execute a landing maneuver at the first instance when the Altitude is below `0.18m`. Note that you still have to navigate through all waypoints for completion of the mission. For e.g., if you land after half of the waypoints are executed, you must takeoff again and continue the mission, you do not need to land again even if the Altitude is below `0.18m`. Fig. 2 shows a video of the expected output.

<a name='codebase'></a>
### 3.2. Codebase

Setup VizFlyt framework from <a href="https://github.com/pearwpi/VizFlyt">here</a>. You do not need the ROS support for P0. The starter code is in the `Phase2` folder of the P0 package you have downloaded before.


<a name='implementation2'></a>
### 3.3. Implementation

You need to implement the following:
- A state machine to monitor and supply the next waypoint. Note that you are given a template starter code in `Phase2\src\usercode.py` with the template class `state_machine`. You are required to fill the `step()` function of this class, where you need to monitor if you have reached the current desired waypoint (you will need to check the Euclidean distance between the current position given as `currpos` in your `step()` function and the desired waypoint) and switch to the landing/next waypoint based on the April Tag ID. To run the code you'll run the `Phase2\src\main.py` and **NOT** `Phase2\src\usercode.py`.
- AprilTag detection for next task to be performed. Your quadrotor is equipped with a down-facing camera and you are provided with a function `fetchLatestImage()` that returns the current camera frame. You can use utilize the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/apriltag/">`apriltag`</a> library to detect april tags, note that you are given tags from the `36h11` tag family. Once you reach a waypoint, fetch the latest camera frame, detect the April Tag ID, if it is `4`, invoke a land command. To land, you have to generate a waypoint with the same `XY` location and `Z` location of 0.1m. Once you have landed, you can takeoff again, i.e., maintain same `XY` location and make the `Z` location 1.5m. Then continue onto the next waypoint if any. If there are no more waypoints left, terminate your code and dance (in real-life)! Note that you do not need the images to test your waypoint switching logic but you'll need the image to know when to land. So you can test your state switching code without landing without the need to render images, this will make your debugging fast.
